**1.Explain what the simple List component does.**

This type of component renders an unordered list of items based on the items prop passed to it and each item is represented by a &lt;li&gt; element

The SingleListItem component is used to render each item. And also, it is a memorized functional component that takes isSelected, onClickHandler, text, and index as props, and it renders a single list item with the given text and index, and

applies the isSelected style if the item is selected. Memorization is a technique used in React to optimize performance by caching the result of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the inputs to the function are the same. This can help reduce the number of times a component needs to re-render and improve the overall performance of the application


The ListComponent component is responsible for rendering the list and handling the item selection. It uses the useState hook to keep track of the selected index in its state, and the useEffect hook to reset the selected index when the items prop changes. The handleClick function is called when an item is clicked and sets the selected index to the clicked item's index.

Hence, the List component provides a simple reusable list component with basic selection functionality, which can be useful in many different types of applications.


**2.What problems / warnings are there with code?**


The warnings that i found during execution are follows:

PropTypes.array: The PropTypes.array used in the WrappedListComponent propTypes definition should be PropTypes.arrayOf instead. This can cause a warning in the console.

setSelectedIndex: The setSelectedIndex hook in the WrappedListComponent has been defined as a function but is being used as a state variable. Instead, it should be const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null); to define the state variable and its setter.

isSelected: The isSelected prop passed to the SingleListItem component is intended to be a boolean value indicating whether or not the item is selected. However, in the current implementation, the isSelected prop is assigned the selectedIndex state variable, which is a number. This can cause a type mismatch and may result in unexpected behavior.

onClickHandler: The onClickHandler prop passed to the SingleListItem component is defined as a required function prop, but it is being invoked immediately in the onClick attribute of the &lt;li&gt; element. Instead, it should be defined as a function that gets called when the &lt;li&gt; element is clicked.

Missing key prop: The SingleListItem component is being rendered inside a loop using the map function, but the key prop is not being passed to each instance of the component. This can cause issues with component re-rendering and can negatively affect performance.

defaultProps: The items prop in the WrappedListComponent has been given a default value of null, but it should instead be set to an empty array [], to prevent the map function from failing if no items are passed.

Addressing these issues should help improve the reliability, functionality, and maintainability of the component.
